        <h4>
        19.
        PAYMENTS AND REFUNDS</h4>

        <p>
        The
        fees applicable for the Service ("<strong>Fees</strong>") are available
        on the Site and/or in lfj.io's then-current published price list. The
        price stated for the Service excludes all taxes and charges, unless
        stated otherwise. You're responsible for any taxes and for all other
        charges (for example, data charges and currency exchange settlements).
        You will pay the Fees in the currency lfj.io quoted for your account.
        lfj.io reserves the right to change the quoted currency at any
        time.</p>

        <p>
        In
        addition to any Fees, you may still incur charges incidental to using
        the Service, for example, charges for Internet access, data roaming,
        and other data transmission charges.</p>

        <p>
        You
        must be authorized to use the payment method that you enter when you
        create a billing account. You authorize us to charge you for the
        Service using your payment method and for any paid feature of the
        Service that you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in
        force. We may bill: (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c)
        shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription
        Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you've approved, and
        we'll notify you in advance of the difference for recurring
        subscription Services. We may bill you simultaneously for more than one
        of your prior billing periods. Once we have informed you that the
        Service will be provided indefinitely or automatically renewed, we may
        automatically renew your Service and charge you for any renewal
        term.</p>

        <p>
        You
        must keep all information in your billing account current. You can
        access and modify your billing account information using the
        Administrative Panel. You may change your payment method at any time.
        If you tell us to stop using your payment method and we no longer
        receive payment from you for the paid Service, we may cancel that
        Service. Your notice to us will not affect charges we submit to your
        billing account before we reasonably could act on your
        request.</p>

        <p>
        We'll
        notify you in advance, either through the Service or to the email
        address you have most recently provided to us, if we change the price
        of the Service. If there's a specific length and price for your Service
        offer, that price will remain in force for that time. After the offer
        period ends, your use of the Service will be charged at the new price.
        If your Service is on a period basis (for example, monthly) with no
        specific length, we'll notify you of any price change at least 30 days
        in advance. If you don't agree to these changes, you must cancel and
        stop using the Service  (with
        cancellation confirmation from a lfj.io representative) no later than
        thirty (30) days prior to the conclusion of your current payment term,
        whether monthly, yearly, or otherwise. If you cancel, your Service ends
        at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account
        on a period basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled. If
        you fail to cancel as required, we will automatically renew the Service
        for the same term and will charge your payment information on file with
        us commencing on the first day of the renewal term.</p>

        <p>
        Unless
        we notify you otherwise, if you're participating in any trial period
        offer, you must cancel the Service by the end of the trial period to
        avoid incurring new charges. If you do not cancel your Service and we
        have told you the Service will convert to a paid subscription at the
        end of the trial period, you authorize us to charge your payment method
        for the Service.</p>

        <p>
        Except
        as specifically set forth in this section, all Services are prepaid for
        the period selected (monthly, yearly or otherwise) and are
        non-refundable. This includes accounts that are renewed.</p>

        <p>
        If you
        are currently on our free 90-day trial, you may cancel or downgrade
        your account, free of charge, at any time until ninety (90) days after
        your account was created. (The day of creation constitutes the first
        day of the 90-day trial.)</p>

        enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of this Terms will
        remain in effect. This is the entire contract between you and us
        regarding the Service. It supersedes any prior contract or oral or

        not assign this contract or transfer any rights to use the
        Service.</p>

        Claims</h4>

        Claims
        must be filed within one year. You must bring any claim related to
        these Terms or the Service within one year of the date you could first

        claims. If it isn't filed in time, the claim is permanently
        barred.</p>

        <h4>
        20.5.
        Waiver</h4>

        <p>
        The
        failure of either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance of
        any of the provisions of these Terms or to exercise any rights or
        remedies under these Terms will not be construed as a waiver or
        relinquishment to any extent of such party's right to assert or rely
        upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance;
        rather, the same will remain in full force and effect.</p>
