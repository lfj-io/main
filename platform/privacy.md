        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

        <p>Your privacy is very important to lfj.io. This privacy policy 
        ("<strong>Policy</strong>") applies to the lfj.io Web sites and
        services and informs you how personal information is collected, used,
        disclosed, and protected by lfj.io. If you use the lfj.io site and 
        services as part of an entity or organization that has service with 
        lfj.io (like your employer or a university), the individual terms of 
        that organization's contract for the service may restrict our collection 
        or use of your personal information more than what is described in this 
        Policy. This statement includes lfj.io's Website Privacy Statements. These terms
        incorporate the following privacy policy located at

        Policy, we will change the "last updated" date above. If there are
        material changes to this Policy, we will notify you more directly. We
        encourage you to check this Policy whenever you use our Web sites and
        services to understand how your personal information is
        used.</p>

        <h3>
        Information we collect</h3>

        <p>
        We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Web sites
        and services. We may also supplement this information with information
        from other companies. We collect two general types of information,
        namely personal information and aggregate data. As used in this Policy,
        the term "personal information" means information that specifically
        identifies an individual (such as a name and email address), and
        demographic and other information when directly linked to information
        that can identify an individual.</p>

        <p>
        The following are the specific types of information we collect from
        you.</p>

        <p><strong>
        Information given to us by you</strong>.
        We collect information you give us on our Web site and when you register
        for and use our services. Examples include the following:</p>

        <p><strong>
        Registration / Profile Information.</strong> When you register/install script
        to use our services or update your profile, we may collect
        various kinds of information about you including, your name and email
        address; your title, company and other profile information you provide;
        demographic information; and information you upload like photos, files,
        and documents.</p>

        <p><strong>
        Contact Information</strong>. 
        We collect the email addresses you provide for contacts you enter or
        upload into your private contacts page. When you choose to collaborate
        or share files with others, we also collect email addresses you provide
        to email invitations to those individuals on your behalf.</p>

        <p><strong>
        Payment Information</strong>. If you choose to use a paid lfj.io account or
        service, our payment processing vendor collects your credit card
        information and billing address.</p>

        <p><strong>
        Submissions and customer surveys.</strong> 
        From time to time we may use surveys, contests or sweepstakes requesting
        personal or demographic information and customer feedback. These are
        completely optional and users are not required to
        participate.</p>

        <p><strong>
        Information that is automatically collected</strong>
        We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact
        with our Web pages, services and communications. For example, it is
        standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to
        every Web site you visit, including ours. That information includes
        your computer's IP address, access times, your browser type,browser fingering
        and language, and referring Web site addresses. We may also collect
        information about the type of operating system you use, your account
        activity, your social user id such as facebook, weibo.. and your uploaded files
        and pages accessed or used by you.</p>

        <p><strong>
        Cookies and Web Beacons</strong>.
        We may also use certain kinds of technology such as cookies and Web
        beacons to collect information. Among other things, the use of cookies
        and Web beacons enables us to improve our Web sites and emails by
        seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number
        of computers accessing our Web site, to personalize and improve your
        experience, to record your preferences, and to allow you to visit our
        Web site without re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie
        is a small amount of data which is sent to your browser from a Web
        site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most
        browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can
        modify your browser setting to reject our cookies or to prompt you
        before accepting a cookie by editing your browser options. However, if
        a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie,
        some portions of the Web site and services may not function properly.
        For example, you may not be able to sign in and access certain Web page
        features or services. A Web beacon is an electronic image, also called
        a "gif," that may be used on our Web pages to deliver cookies, count
        visits and compile statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness or in
        our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted
        upon.</p>
